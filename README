Required Modules:
    - dpkt; URL: http://code.google.com/p/dpkt/downloads/list
    
Command-Line Arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -f FILENAME, --file=FILENAME
                            pcap file containing files to be retransmitted
      -s SKIP_TIME, --skip=SKIP_TIME
                            time in seconds to skip at the beginning
      -t, --fast            send packets immediately one after another ignoring time intervals
      -d, --debug           show debug messages
      
Helpful Information:
    - 2013-06-30-1.pcap contains packets captured during PSAS rocket launch on June 30th, 2013s
    - It contains 15332 frames captured within 45.65 minutes
    - Time Periods:
        Start (sec) End (sec)   Duration (min)  Activity
        ------------------------------------------------
        0           756         12.6            sending
        756         2454        28.3            idle
        2454        2509        0.9             sending
        2509        2577        1.1             idle
        2577        2739        2.7             sending
    - To make the program skip processing first packets and start from later time, use
        python server.py -s NNNN
      where NNNN is the number of seconds to skip. For example, to start watching/sending packets from time period 3 (and show debug information), use 
        python server.py -d -s 2454
    - To process all packets without time intervals between, add the '-t' option:
        python server.py -d -s 2454 -t
